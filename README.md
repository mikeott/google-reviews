# Google Reviews
Use the Google Places API to display Google business reviews on your website.

**Note:** The JS was originally sourced from [Peledies](https://github.com/peledies) Google Places jQuery Plugin [(here)](https://github.com/peledies/google-places) although I've tweaked it a little with additional schema, user avatars, less convoluted mark-up and limited the functionality to only show reviews.

The file (reviews.php) is more contained (no external JS, aside from the jQuery requirement) and also inludes a simple configuration via a bunch of PHP variables. You could just make it a server side include and not have to think about it.

**Requirements:** Google maps API key, with Maps JavaScript API and Places API both enabled via your [Google API console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis).

**Pro tips:** 

* Get your place ID from [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-placeid-finder).

* Remove `<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.min.js"></script>` from reviews.php if your project already uses jQuery.

## Limitations ##

The API will only allow you to return a maximum of five reviews, and these will always be limited to the reviews Google says are 'Most Relevant'.

This is confounded with another problem: If you want to return five reviews, and only reviews that have five stars, and one of the reviews only has four stars, then only four reviews will be returned.

**For example:** As you can see in the [Perth Airport Google Reviews](https://goo.gl/vYCorg) (screenshot below), when sorted by 'Most Relevant' only two of the first five reviews have 5 Stars. And so if you want to only show reviews with 5 Stars, then only those two reviews will be returned. It appears that for whatever reason the Places API won't attempt to look beyond the five 'Most Relevant' reviews, and so that's what we're limited to.

In a situation like this it may be preferable to make the `$min_star` value 3 instead, which means the API will look for all 'Most Relevant' reviews from 3 to 5 Stars (which in the case of Perth Airport below would mean three reviews would be returned).
